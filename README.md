## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Mohamed, a curious and driven creator who enjoys learning by building and experimenting with real projects.

I spend a large part of my time exploring how software systems work, strengthening my fundamentals, and turning ideas into functional prototypes. I believe real understanding comes from hands on practice, iteration, and continuous learning.

I am not focused on titles or labels. My focus is on understanding how things work, building practical systems, and improving steadily over time through consistency and curiosity.

## 🛠️ 0x00 > Environment & Tools

<p align="center">

</p>

These are the core tools and environments I use while learning and building real projects.

My approach is straightforward:
- learn by building, not memorizing  
- experiment, break things, and fix them  
- focus on how systems work under the hood  
- improve step by step through hands-on work  

This setup reflects my current path: exploring systems, game logic, networking, and performance through practical experimentation.

## 🧩 0x01 > Projects & Learning

I work on small to medium-scale projects that help me understand:
- client–server architecture  
- real-time systems  
- performance considerations  
- persistence and state management  

One example is **Maincraft**, a Minecraft-inspired multiplayer voxel engine prototype built for learning purposes.

You can explore my work here:

Projects evolve as I learn — nothing here is “finished”, everything is a step forward.
