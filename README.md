👋 Hi, I'm M4joux

I'm a game and engine developer focused on building voxel-based systems, real-time simulations, and multiplayer architectures.

I enjoy working close to the fundamentals: how worlds are generated, how data flows between client and server, and how performance scales as complexity grows.

🧠 About Me

I build voxel engines inspired by Minecraft-like worlds

I focus on clean architecture and deterministic logic

I'm interested in procedural generation, physics, and networked gameplay

I prefer understanding systems deeply rather than relying on heavy abstractions

🛠️ Technical Interests

JavaScript / TypeScript

Python (procedural systems)

Node.js (server-side logic)

Three.js / WebGL

Multiplayer game architecture

Chunk streaming & greedy meshing

🎯 What I Care About

Correct logic before visual polish

Systems that are simple, predictable, and efficient

Prototypes that actually run and can evolve

Learning by building real systems from scratch

📌 Currently

Experimenting with voxel world generation

Improving collision, physics, and world logic

Exploring multiplayer synchronization models
